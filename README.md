Human Tracking (MOT Project)

This project is an academic homework for Multi-Object Tracking (MOT). It demonstrates real-time human detection and tracking using computer vision techniques.

Project Highlights:

Implemented real-time tracking with object detection and Kalman Filter-based tracking.

Designed data pipelines for video frame extraction, feature processing, and ID assignment.

Optimized tracking stability and reduced ID switching while maintaining high inference speed (FPS).

Developed skills in model training, feature extraction, and system integration for real-time tracking applications.
